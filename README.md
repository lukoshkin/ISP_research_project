# ISP Research Project

In this repository, an example of naive parallel techniques is used in modelling the interaction of an intense laser pulse
with a solid-state target. The target of the project was to write several wrapping scripts over the given program `1dpic.e`
(I didn't ask the permission to publish its source code, so I just will not do this. So, binary-code compatibility problems
may arise if someone decides to reproduce the results) which derive values of the ellipticity of the reflected light
in parallel, for different angles of incidence. The file `stats.csv` contains the target variables of this toy problem (which,
however, is a part of the large) along with the parameters values at which the former were obtained. See a more detailed
description of the project in the document `ISP_research_project_report.pdf`.
